# üé∂ SQL Agent Ollama: Talk to Your Database with LLMs! ü§ñ

Welcome to **SQL Agent Ollama** ‚Äî your AI-powered data explorer!  
Ask questions in plain English and let state-of-the-art language models (`llama3.1`, `cogito`, `llama3`) do the SQL heavy lifting on the classic Chinook music database.

## üöÄ What is This?

This notebook is a hands-on demo of how you can:
- Connect to a SQLite database (`Chinook.db`)
- Use LangChain‚Äôs SQL agent toolkit
- Harness the power of multiple Ollama LLMs
- Query your data with natural language ‚Äî no SQL expertise needed!

## üìù How to Use

Open the [`SQL AGENT OLLAMA.ipynb`](c:\Users\ruchita.maaran\Downloads\SQL%20AGENT%20OLLAMA.ipynb) notebook and run the cells step by step.

- **Connect to the database and preview tables**
- **Create a SQL agent with your favorite LLM:**
    ```python
    from langchain_ollama.llms import OllamaLLM
    llm = OllamaLLM(model="llama3.1")  # or "cogito", or "llama3"
    ```
- **Ask your questions in English!**  
  The agent will translate them into SQL, run the queries, and show you the answers.
